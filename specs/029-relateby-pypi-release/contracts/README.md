# Contracts: 029-relateby-pypi-release

This directory holds process and data contracts for the **unified** Relateby PyPI release (one project `relateby`, one install, both `relateby.pattern` and `relateby.gram`). There are no HTTP or RPC APIs; the feature is packaging and release only.

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [release-process.md](./release-process.md) | Release process contract for the unified package: single version, one build, one publish; implementations (docs, scripts, CI) should align with this contract. |
