# Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating how to use the gram library from different language environments.

## Available Examples

### WASM/JavaScript

The `wasm-js/` example demonstrates how to compile and use the gram library in a WebAssembly/JavaScript environment.

See [wasm-js/README.md](wasm-js/README.md) for build and usage instructions.

## Future Examples

### Python

Python bindings using `pyo3` will be added in a future release. This will allow using the gram library directly from Python code.

### C

C bindings using `cbindgen` will be added in a future release. This will generate C-compatible headers for integration with C/C++ projects.
